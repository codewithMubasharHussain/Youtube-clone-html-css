**Description**
This is my third project, a simple YouTube clone built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project features a sidebar menu with hide and show functionality, a video page to mimic the video playback experience, and a comments section for user interaction.

**Features**
Sidebar Menu: A collapsible sidebar that can be shown or hidden for easy navigation.
Video Page: A mockup of YouTubeâ€™s video player page, including space for a video player, video title, views, and other details.
Comments Section: A basic comments area where users can read and add comments, simulating a real YouTube-like experience.

**Technologies Used**
HTML: For structuring the web pages.
CSS: For styling, layout, and responsive design elements.
JavaScript: To implement the sidebar hide/show functionality and other interactive features.

**Future Improvements**
Add search functionality to filter and find videos more easily.
Enhance the comments section with features like reply, like, and timestamp.
Implement additional pages like a Homepage with recommended videos and a Subscription page.
